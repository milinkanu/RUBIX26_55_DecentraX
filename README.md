## 📖 The Story

We've all been there. That sinking feeling when you reach for your phone, wallet, or keys... and they aren't there.

In a world of disconnected social media posts and chaotic WhatsApp groups, recovering lost items feels like finding a needle in a haystack. **FoundIt! changes that.**

We built FoundIt! to create a **Trust Protocol** for lost items. It's not just a listing site; it's a smart matching engine that protects privacy, verifies ownership through intelligent questioning, and facilitates safe recovery without exposing personal contact details until you're ready.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 **Smart Verify™ System**
Stop spam and fake claims. When posting a "Found" item, users create **hidden verification questions** (e.g., "What is the wallpaper?" or "Any scratches?"). Claimants must answer these correctly to prove ownership before chat is unlocked.

### 💬 **Secure Anonymous Chat**
No need to share your phone number with strangers. Our **built-in real-time chat** allows finders and owners to coordinate meetups safely within the platform. Includes photo sharing for extra proof.

### 🔔 **Intelligent Matching & Notifications**
You don't have to refresh the page all day. our system runs looking for potential matches based on category, location, and keywords. If someone posts what you lost, you get notified instantly.

### 🛡️ **Admin Governance**
A robust admin panel ensures the platform remains clean. Admins can review flagged items, handle reports, and ban malicious users to keep the community safe.

### 📍 **Hyper-Local Search**
Filter items by City, Area, Category, and Type (Lost vs. Found) to find exactly what you are looking for in seconds.

2.  **Verify**: If it's a "Found" item, the finder sets a secret question.
3.  **Search**: Users browse or get auto-matched with items.
4.  **Claim**: The owner attempts to claim the item by answering the secret question.
5.  **Connect**: If verified, a secure chat channel opens up.
6.  **Recover**: Users meet safely, exchange the item, and mark the case as **Resolved**.
